# Wi-Fi Optimizer

This project is a web application designed to help non-technical users analyze and optimize their local Wi-Fi networks. It addresses common issues like channel interference and poor signal strength by providing clear diagnostics and recommendations.

The key feature is an integrated **LLM (AI) assistant** that translates complex network data into simple, step-by-step instructions for improving network performance (e.g., changing router channels or physical placement).

*This application is being developed as part of a Master of Science in Computer Science.*
